    <div class="description">
        According to a study by the Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), 21% of all fatal accidents are due to drowsy
        driving. It's a serious issue and most people that have driven for long hours at night can relate to the fact
        that fatigue and a slight brief state of unconsciousness can happen to anyone and everyone.
        <br> <br>
        From an e-rickshaw driver to taxi driver I created "Third Eye", a deep
        learning and Django-based website (and mobile application in the future) that detects the drowsiness of the
        driver in real-time with the help of eye blinking and yawning of the driver. After detection in two different
        states, drowsing, and sleeping, it will immediately sound an alarm.
        <br> <br>
        Now, any driver can open the application, give the camera access, and put the mobile on the mobile holder in the
        car, and be secure.
